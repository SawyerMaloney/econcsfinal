rubenstein -- papers eight years ago on hardness on approximation
approximating nash
    epsilon nash where low incentive to deviate. But can be randomizing over horrible choices
    well supposrted, only play strategies that are epsilon strategically optimal -- suboptimal, but not putting weight on a terrible strategy, only on approximally optimal strategies
    small epilson for which calculating equivalent nash is still hard

Hollender
    pure circuit as an intermediate problem that is easier for PPAD
    The complexity of gradient descent
    forefront of TFNP
